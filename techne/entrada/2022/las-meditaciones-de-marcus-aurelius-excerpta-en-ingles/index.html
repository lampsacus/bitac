    <p>Book I</p>
    <p>4. «From my grandfather's father, to dispense with attendance at public schools, and to enjoy good teachers at
      home, and to recognize that on such things money should be eagerly spent.»</p>
    <p>8. «From Apollonius, self-reliance and an unequivocal determination not to leave anything to chance; and to look
      to nothing else even for a moment save Reason alone; and to remain ever the same, in the throes of pain, on the
      loss of a child, during a lingering illness; and to see plainly from a living example that one and the same man
      can be very vehement and yet gentle: not to be impatient in instructing others; and to see in him a man who
      obviously counted as the least among his gifts his practical experience and facility in imparting philosophic
      truths; and to learn in accepting seeming favours from friends not to give up our independence for such things nor
      take them callously as a matter of course.»</p>
    <p>11. «From Pronto, to note the envy, the subtlety, and the dissimulation which are habitual to a tyrant; and that,
      as a general rule, those amongst us who rank as patricians are somewhat wanting in natural affection.»</p>
    <p>12. «From Alexander the Platonist, not to say to anyone often or without necessity, nor write in a letter, I am
      too busy, nor in this fashion constantly plead urgent affairs as an excuse for evading the obligations entailed
      upon us by our relations towards those around us.»</p>
    <p>Book II</p>
    <p>1. «Say to to yourself at daybreak: I shall come across the busy-body, the thankless, the bully, the treacherous,
      the envious, the unneighbourly. All this has befallen them because they know not good from evil. But I, in that I
      have comprehended the nature of the Good that it is beautiful, and the nature of Evil that it is ugly, and the
      nature of the wrong-doer himself that it is akin to me, not as partaker of the same blood and seed but of
      intelligence and a morsel of the Divine, can neither be injured by any of them for no one can involve Me in what
      is debasing nor can I be wroth with my kinsman and hate him. For we have come into being for co-operation, as have
      the feet, the hands, the eyelids, the rows of upper and lower teeth. Therefore to thwart one another is against
      Nature; and we do thwart one another by shewing resentment and aversion.»</p>
    <p>8. «Not easily is a man found to be unhappy by reason of his not regarding what is going on in another man’s
      soul; but those who do not attend closely to the motions of their own souls must inevitably be unhappy.»</p>
    <p>14. «Even if thy life is to last three thousand years or for the matter of that thirty thousand, yet bear in mind
      that no one ever parts with any other life than the one he is now living nor lives any other than that which he
      now parts with.»</p>
    <p>15. «Remember that everything is but what we think of it. For obvious indeed is the saying fathered on Monimus
      the Cynic, obvious too the utility of what was said, if one accepts the gist of it as far as it is true.»</p>
    <p>16. «The soul of man does wrong to itself then most of all, when it makes itself, as far as it can do so, an
      imposthume and as it were a malignant growth in the Universe. For to grumble at anything that happens is a
      rebellion against Nature, in some part of which are bound up the natures of all other things. And the soul wrongs
      itself then again, when it turns away from any man or even opposes him with intent to do him harm, as is the case
      with those who are angry. It does wrong to itself, thirdly, when it on any thing whatever aimlessly and
      unadvisedly, whereas even the most trifling things should be done with reference to the end in view. Now the end
      for rational beings is to submit themselves to the reason and law of that archetypal city and polity – the
      Universe.»</p>
    <p>Book III</p>
    <p>16. «Body, Soul, Intelligence: for the body sensations, for the soul desires, for the intelligence axioms. To
      receive impressions by way of the senses is not denied even to cattle; to be as puppets pulled by the strings of
      desire is common to wild beasts and to pathics and to a Phalaris and a Nero. Yet to have the intelligence a guide
      to what they deem their duty is an attribute of those also who do not believe in Gods and those who fail their
      country in its need and those who do their deeds behind closed doors.</p>
    <p>If then all else is the common property of the classes mentioned, there is left as the characteristic of the good
      man to delight in and to welcome what befalls and what is spun for him by destiny ; and not to sully the divine
      genius that is enthroned in his bosom, nor yet to perplex it with a multitude of impressions, but to maintain it
      to the end in a gracious serenity, in orderly obedience to God, uttering no word that is not true and doing no
      deed that is not just. But if all men disbelieve in his living a simple and modest and cheerful life, he is not
      wroth with any of them, nor swerves from the path which leads to his life s goal, whither he must go pure,
      peaceful, ready for release, needing no force to bring him into accord with his lot.»</p>
    <p>Book IV</p>
    <p>7. Efface the opinion, I am harmed, and at once the feeling of being harmed disappears ; efface the feeling, and
      the harm disappears at once.»</p>
    <p>17. «Behave not as though thou hadst ten thousand years to live. Thy doom hangs over thee. While thou livest,
      while thou mayest, become good.»</p>
    <p>18. «What richness of leisure doth he gain who has no eyes for his neighbor’s words or deeds or thoughts, but
      only for his own doings, that they be just and righteous! Verily it is not for the good man to peer about into the
      blackness of another’s heart, ‘but to run straight for the goal with never a glance aside’.»</p>
    <p>25. «Try living the life of the good man who is more than content with what is allotted to him out of the whole,
      and is satisfied with his own acts as just and his own disposition as kindly: see how that answers.»</p>
    <p>43. «As a river of all things that come into being, aye, a rushing torrent, is Time. No sooner is a thing sighted
      than it is carried past, and lo, another is passing, and it too will be carried away.»</p>
    <p>Book V</p>
    <p>10. «Things are in a sense so wrapped up in mystery that not a few philosophers, and they no ordinary ones, have
      concluded that they are wholly beyond our comprehension: nay, even the Stoics themselves find them hard to
      comprehend. Indeed every assent we give to the impressions of our senses is liable to error, for where is the man
      who never errs? Pass on then to the objective things themselves, how transitory they are, how worthless, the
      property, quite possibly, of a boy-minion, a harlot, or a brigand. After that turn to the characters of thine
      associates, even the most refined of whom it is difficult to put up with, let alone the fact that a man has enough
      to do to endure himself. What then there can be amid such murk and nastiness, and in so ceaseless an ebbing of
      substance and of time, of movement and things moved, that deserves to be greatly valued or to excite our ambition
      in the least, I cannot even conceive. On the contrary, a man should take heart of grace to await his natural
      dissolution, and without any chafing at delay comfort himself with these twin thoughts alone: the one, that
      nothing will befall me that is not in accord with the Nature of the Universe; the other, that it is in my power to
      do nothing contrary to the God and the ‘genius’ within me. For noone can force me to disobey that.»</p>
    <p>17. «To crave impossibilities is lunacy ; but it is impossible for the wicked to act otherwise.»</p>
    <p>Book VI</p>
    <p>13. «As in the case of meat and similar eatables the thought strikes us, this is the dead body of a fish, this of
      a fowl or pig; and again that this Falernian is merely the juice of a grape-cluster, and this purple-edged robe is
      nought but sheep’s wool steeped in the blood of a shell-fish; or, of sexual intercourse, that it is merely
      internal attrition and the spasmodic excretion of mucus, – such, I say, as are these impressions that get to grips
      with the actual things and enter into the heart of them, so as to see them as they really are, thus should it be
      thy life through, and where things look to be above measure convincing, laying them quite bare, behold their
      paltriness and strip off their conventional prestige. For conceit is a past master in fallacies and, when thou
      flatterest thyself most that thou art engaged in worthy tasks, then art thou most of all deluded by it. At any
      rate, see what Crates has to say about none other than Xenocrates.»</p>
    <p>19. «Because thou findest a thing difficult for thyself to accomplish do not conceive it to be impracticable for
      others ; but whatever is possible for a man and in keeping with his nature consider also attainable by thyself.»
    </p>
    <p>24. «Death reduced to the same condition Alexander the Macedonian and his muleteer, for either they were taken
      back into the same Seminal Reason of the Universe or scattered alike into the atoms.»</p>
    <p>33. «For hand or foot to feel pain is no violation of nature, so long as the foot does its own appointed work,
      and the hand its own. Similarly pain for a man, as man, is no unnatural thing so long as he does a man’s appointed
      work. But, if not unnatural, then is it not an evil either.»</p>
    <p>36. «Asia, Europe, corners of the Universe : the whole Ocean a drop in the Universe : Athos but a little clod
      therein : all the present a point in Eternity : everything on a tiny scale, so easily changed, so quickly
      vanished.»</p>
    <p>Book VII</p>
    <p>1. «What is vice? A familiar sight enough. So in everything that befalls have the thought ready: This is a
      familiar sight. Look up, look down, every where thou wilt find the same things, where of histories ancient,
      medieval, and modern are full; and full of them at this day are cities and houses. There is no new thing under the
      sun. Everything is stereotyped no new, everything fleeting.»</p>
    <p>4. «In conversation keep abreast of what is being of what is done, and in every effort, of what is being done. In
      the latter see from the first to what end it has reference, and in the former be careful to catch the meaning.»
    </p>
    <p>21. «A little while and thou wilt have forgotten everything, a little while and everything will have forgotten
      thee.»</p>
    <p>69. «This is the mark of a perfect character, to pass through each day as if it were the last, without agitation,
      without torpor, without pretense.»</p>
    <p>70. «The Gods -and they are immortal- do not take it amiss that for a time so long they must inevitably and
      always put up with worthless men who are what they are and so many, nay they even befriend them in all manner of
      ways. But thou, though destined to die so soon, criest off, and that too though thou art one of the worthless ones
      thyself.»</p>
    <p>71. «It is absurd not to eschew our own wickedness, which is possible, but to eschew that of others, which is not
      possible.»</p>
    <p>72. «Whatever thy rational and civic faculty discovers to be neither intelligent nor social, it judges with good
      reason to fall short of its own standard.»</p>
    <p>Book VIII</p>
    <p>2. «In every action ask thyself, How does it affect me? Shall I regret it? But a little and I am dead and all
      that lies between is past. What more do I ask for, as long as my present work is that of a living creature,
      intelligent, social, and under one law with God?»</p>
    <p>26. «It brings gladness to a man to do a man s true work. And a man s true work is to shew goodwill to his own
      kind, to disdain the motions of the senses, to diagnose specious impressions, to take a comprehensive view of the
      Nature of the Universe and all that is done at her bidding.»</p>
    <p>27. «Thou hast three relationships the first to the vessel thou art contained in; the second to the divine Cause
      wherefrom issue all things to all; and the third to those that dwell with thee.»</p>
    <p>43. «One thing delights one, another thing another. To me it is a delight if I keep my ruling Reason sound, not
      looking askance at man or anything that befalls man, but regarding all things with kindly eyes, accepting and
      using everything for its intrinsic worth.»</p>
    <p>51. «Be not dilatory in doing, nor confused in conversation, nor vague in thought; let not thy soul be wholly
      concentred in itself nor uncontrollably agitated; leave thyself leisure in thy life.</p>
    <p>They kill us, they cut us limit from limb, they hunt us with execrations! How does that prevent thy mind being
      still pure, sane, sober, just?Imagine a man to stand by a crystal-clear spring of sweet water, and to rail at it ;
      yet it fails not to bubble up with wholesome water. Throw in mud or even filth and it will quickly winnow them
      away and purge itself of them and take never a stain. How then possess thyself of a living fountain and no mere
      well? By guiding thyself carefully every hour into freedom with kindliness, simplicity, and modesty.»</p>
    <p>53. «Carest thou to be praised by a man who execrates himself thrice within the hour? to win the approval of a
      man who wins not his own? Can he be said to win his own approval who regrets almost every thing he does?»</p>

    <p>Book IX</p>
    <p>4. «He that does wrong, does wrong to himself. The unjust man is unjust to himself, for he makes himself bad.»
    </p>
    <p>5. «There is often an injustice of omission as well as of commission.»</p>
    <p>19. «Change is the universal experience. Thou art thyself undergoing a perpetual transformation in some sort,
      decay: aye and the whole Universe as well.»</p>
    <p>27. «When men blame or hate thee or give utterance to some such feelings against thee, turn to their souls, enter
      into them, and see what sort of men they are. Thou wilt perceive that thou needest not be concerned as to what
      they think of thee. Yet must thou feel kindly towards them, for Nature made them dear to thee. The Gods too lend
      them aid in divers ways by dreams and oracles, to win those very things on which their hearts are set.»</p>
    <p>30. «Take a bird eye’s view of the world, its endless gatherings and endless ceremonials, voyagings manifold in
      storm and calm, and the vicissitudes of things coming into being, participating in being, ceasing to be. Reflect
      too on the life lived long ago by other men, and the life that shall be lived after thee, and is now being lived
      in barbarous countries; and how many have never even heard thy name, and how many will very soon forget it, and
      how many who now perhaps acclaim, will very soon blame thee, and that neither memory nor fame nor anything thing
      else whatever is worth reckoning.»</p>
    <p>5. …But above all, when thou findest fault with a man for faithlessness and ingratitude, turn thy thoughts to
      thyself. For evidently the fault is thine own, whether thou hadst faith that a man with such a character would
      keep faith with thee, or if in bestowing a kindness thou didst not bestow it absolutely and as from the very doing
      of it having at once received the full complete fruit. For when thou hast done a kindness, what more wouldst thou
      have? Is not this enough that thou hast done something in accordance with thy nature? Seekest thou a recompense
      for it? As though the eye should claim a guerdon for seeing, or the feet for walking! For just as these latter
      were made for their special work, and by carrying this out according to their individual constitution they come
      fully into their own, so also man, formed as he is by nature for benefiting others, when he has acted as bene
      factor or as co-factor in any other way for the general weal, has done what he was constituted for, and has what
      is his.»</p>
    <p>Book X</p>
    <p>6. «Whether there be atoms or a Nature, let it be postulated first, that I am a part of the whole Universe
      controlled by Nature; secondly, that I stand in some intimate connexion with other kindred parts. For bearing this
      in mind, as I am a part, I shall not be displeased with anything allotted me from the Whole. For what is
      advantageous to the whole can in no wise be injurious part to the part. For the Whole contains nothing that is not
      advantageous to itself; and all natures have this in common, but the Universal Nature is endowed with the
      additional attribute of never being forced by any external cause to engender anything hurtful to itself.»</p>
    <p>11. «Make thy own a scientific system of enquiry into the mutual change of all things, and pay diligent heed to
      this branch of study and exercise thyself in it. For nothing is so conducive to greatness of mind.»</p>
    <p>18. «Regarding attentively every existing thing reflect that it is already disintegrating and changing, and as it
      were in a state of decomposition and dispersion, or that everything is by nature made but to die.»Book XI</p>
    <p>5. «What is thy vocation? To be a good man.»</p>
    <p>9. «As those who withstand thy progress along the path of right reason will never be able to turn thee aside from
      sound action, so let them not wrest thee from a kindly attitude towards them; watch over thyself in both
      directions alike, not only in steadfastness of judgment and action but also in gentleness towards those who
      endeavour to stand in thy path or be in some other way a thorn in thy side. For in fact it is a sign of weakness
      to be wroth with them, no less than to shrink from action and be terrified into surrender. For they that do the
      one or the other are alike deserters of their post, the one as a coward, the other as estranged from a natural
      kinsman and friend.»</p>
    <p>18. «Firstly: Consider thy relation to mankind and that we came into the world for the sake of one another; and
      taking another point of view, that I have come into it to be set over men, as a ram over a flock or a bull over a
      herd. Start at the beginning from this premiss: If not atoms, then an all-controlling Nature. If the latter, then
      the lower are for the sake of the higher and the higher for one another.»</p>
    <p>25. «Socrates refused the invitation of Perdiccas to his court, That I come not, said he, to a dishonoured grave,
      meaning, that I be not treated with generosity and have no power to return it.»Book XII</p>
    <p>14. There must be either a predestined Necessity and inviolable plan, or a gracious Providence, or a chaos
      without design or director. If then there be an inevitable Necessity, why kick against the pricks? If a Providence
      that is ready to be gracious, render thyself worthy of divine succour. But if a chaos without guide, congratulate
      thyself that amid such a surging sea thou hast in thyself a guiding Reason.</p>
